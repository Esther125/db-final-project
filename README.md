# Dormy
Dormy is a comprehensive web-based dormitory management system tailored specifically for the National Chengchi University (NCCU) community. Developed using Java Spring Boot for the backend and MySQL for database management, Dormy adopts the MVC framework to offer a robust and scalable architecture. This platform is designed to streamline the operations of dormitory residents and administrators alike, enhancing the efficiency and experience of borrowing and returning items within the dormitory.

## Key Features

Dormy stands out with several key features designed to simplify and improve dormitory management:

- **Efficiency for Both Residents and Administrators**: By considering the operational convenience of both students and dormitory staff, Dormy facilitates a smoother and more efficient borrowing and returning process.

- **Digitization of Borrowing and Returning Records**: Transitioning from paper-based to digital records through a well-designed database significantly reduces the chances of errors and boosts administrative efficiency. Utilizing database constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `CASCADE`) ensures data integrity and minimizes mistakes.

- **Real-time Item Status Inquiry**: Students can easily check the status of items online, eliminating the need to visit the service desk frequently for inquiries.

- **Overdue Notification System**: An automated system detects overdue items and compiles a list of delinquencies. Administrators can then send reminder emails with a single click, saving considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent making individual calls.
